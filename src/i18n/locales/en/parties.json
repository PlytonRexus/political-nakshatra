        "Uniform Civil Code advocacy",

        "PM-KISAN Direct Benefits",
        "Ram Mandir construction",
        "Infrastructure development focus"
      ],
      "reasoning": "BJP combines moderate-high economic statism through extensive welfare schemes (PM-KISAN, Ayushman Bharat) and infrastructure spending with low recognition politics (opposition to minority \"appeasement\", push for UCC, majoritarian Hindu identity). SID is moderately particularist due to focus on Hindu majority interests but tempered by technology-driven universal welfare delivery (DBT, Aadhaar).",
      "electoralStrength": "National, strong in North and West India"

      "name": "Indian National Congress",

        "OBC and SC/ST reservations",
        "Secularism protection"
      ],
      "reasoning": "Congress historically champions high statism (public sector, welfare state) and high recognition politics (minority rights, reservations, pluralism). However, organizational decline has led to increased reliance on identity-based patronage networks, making it moderately particularist in distribution.",

      "reasoning": "AAP represents very high statism through extensive state-provided welfare (free water, electricity, education, healthcare). Moderate recognition (supports reservations but less focused on identity politics).

      "reasoning": "BSP is the quintessential recognition party, focused almost exclusively on Dalit empowerment and SC/ST rights (very high recognition). Highly particularist in distribution, explicitly favoring SC/ST constituencies through ethnic headcount politics. Moderate statism as a tool for group advancement rather than broader economic ideology.",

      "reasoning": "CPI(M) represents traditional left statism (very high - public sector, planning, redistribution). Moderate recognition: supports reservations but emphasizes class over caste/religion.
