  "methodology": {
    "title": "Methodology",
    "intro": "Political Nakshatra is based on academic research showing that the traditional Western political compass (Left-Right economic, Authoritarian-Libertarian social) fails to accurately describe Indian political realities.",
    "framework": "Instead, we use a three-dimensional framework specifically designed for multi-ethnic, post-colonial democracies like India:"
  },
  "comparison": {
    "title": "Comparison with Western Political Models",
    "intro": "Political Nakshatra is designed specifically for Indian political realities, while the Political Compass and similar Western models were developed for liberal democracies in Europe and North America. While there is some conceptual overlap, direct mapping between the frameworks is not possible.",
    "context": "Understanding how this model differs from familiar Western frameworks helps contextualize where you stand in the Indian political constellation."
